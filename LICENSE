Free Use Grant – Created by Michael Barak (© 2025)

If this software (and whatever comes with it) ends up in your hands, consider yourself invited to do pretty much whatever you want with it—no payment needed. You can copy it, tweak it, smash it together with something else, release it to the world, sell it, gift it, remix it, or hand it off to someone else who wants to do the same. It’s all fair game.

There’s only one real ask here:

Don’t forget to carry this note with you. Whether you’re using a big chunk of the software or just a small part, make sure this little message and the name up top stay included. It’s a small price for full creative freedom.

As for everything else?

You’re on your own. If you turn this code into something awesome—great! If it backfires, crashes your system, ruins your weekend, or triggers a domino effect that somehow ends in intergalactic catastrophe… well, that’s not on me. Seriously. I’m not offering support, I’m not offering guarantees, and I definitely can’t stop your dog from chewing through your Ethernet cable.

Honestly: this software is handed over just the way it is. This software is provided without any warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability or fitness for a specific purpose. Users accept all risks associated with its use, irrespective of potential issues such as software defects, legal complications, or other unforeseen circumstances.
